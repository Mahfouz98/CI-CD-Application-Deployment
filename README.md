![Blank diagram (1)](https://github.com/Mahfouz98/CI-CD-Application-Deployment/assets/145352617/9bacf556-522b-4e07-9194-65f4d02f05e1)

## Description ‚òÄÔ∏è

**Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application.**
This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, they are required to log in to add/ edit the board games and their reviews. The 'users' have the authority to add board games to the list and add reviews, and the 'managers' have the authority to edit/ delete the reviews on top of the authorities of users.  

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

- Terraform
- Ansible
- Java
- Docker
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf
- Thymeleaf Fragments
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Spring MVC
- JDBC
- H2 Database Engine (In-memory)
- JUnit test framework
- Spring Security
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Maven

## Features ‚òÅÔ∏è

- Full-Stack Application
- UI components created with Thymeleaf and styled with Twitter Bootstrap
- Authentication and authorization using Spring Security
  - Authentication by allowing the users to authenticate with a username and password
  - Authorization by granting different permissions based on the roles (non-members, users, and managers)
- Different roles (non-members, users, and managers) with varying levels of permissions
  - Non-members only can see the boardgame lists and reviews
  - Users can add board games and write reviews
  - Managers can edit and delete the reviews
- Deployed the application on AWS EC2
- JUnit test framework for unit testing
- Spring MVC best practices to segregate views, controllers, and database packages
- JDBC for database connectivity and interaction
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data in the database
- Schema.sql file to customize the schema and input initial data
- Thymeleaf Fragments to reduce redundancy of repeating HTML elements (head, footer, navigation)

## Steps for Project üöÄ

- Clone the Repo  `git clone https://github.com/Mahfouz98/CI-CD-Application-Deployment`
- Create SonarQube Server
  - Create EC2 Instance
  - Install docker on the machine, Save that Code on a file and `chmod +x <file_name>` and run it as a script 
    
 ```
      # Add Docker's official GPG key:
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
      sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
      sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
      sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

      # Add the repository to Apt sources:
      echo \
        "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
        $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
        sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
      sudo apt-get update
```

- Run sonarqube container `docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name Sonarserver sonarqube` First credentials is user:admin, pass:admin
- Create a dockerhub account to Push Your image in
- Add your credentials in github secret

- Don't forget to Create S3 Bucket for backend statefile of terraform


### Run Pipeline, Everything Else is Automated

- As long as i'm using K8s Cluster using EC2 instances not EKS nor IAM roles, I can't get LoadBalancer external IP
- To Check your Website Access it By    ` <NODE_IP>:<NODE_PORT>`   , In my case it was   `<Worker1>:<31102>`

## How to Run

- To use initial user data, use the following credentials.
  - username: bugs    |     password: bunny (user role)
  - username: daffy   |     password: duck  (manager role)
- You can also sign-up as a new user and customize your role to play with the application! üòä
